Naming conventions
------------------

In `uncritical.items` you'll find all the items that will not trigger any rules
if you update the file. In `critical.<object>.items` you will find items that
will probably trigger rules when you update the file.

The separation was made so that uncritical items can be safely modified without
triggering any rules.
